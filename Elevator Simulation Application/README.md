# Elevator Simulation Application

>**Brief**

**Elevator Simulator** is a .Net windows form application that simulates elevator's logic using arduino input. We have a keypad that has been installed and initialized on the arduino. The user can call the elevator to a specific floor based on the pressed keypad button. Once pressed, it sends a string through a pre-defined port that will be handled in the C# code to move the elevator.
