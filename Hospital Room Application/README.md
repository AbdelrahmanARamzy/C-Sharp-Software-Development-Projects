>**Brief**

**Wanda Application** is a .Net windows form application which represents a simple hospital room system that allows the user to store hospital rooms information and specifications on cloud database, modify and remove them based on real-life hospital room data sheet. This application can be used by clinical engineer to setup & maintain medical devices, find issues and fix them quickly, and deliver a report to the medical staff.

>**Overview**

This application consists of 4 screens as follows:

* Login Screen: this screen used for authentication, as the user should enter valid username and password to be able to use the application. (this part is crucial because hospital rooms info is very sensitive, that's why it's shouldn't be open for everyone to modify).

* Main Screen: the main menu screen and also considered to be home screen for the users when they are done modifying rooms info.

* Room Info Screen: the user can insert, modify and delete room info through this screen.

* Room Specs Screen: the user can add room specifications through this screen.
